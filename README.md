# DA-LITE-MONIKA-PDB
Files for the final project for Digital Academy a course by Czechitas supported by Google.org.
The final project is about prediction the attrition of employees using machine learning models.
There will not be much to find and note that before the academy I was a complete noob. I knew Excel and that was it.
In the Academy we learnt Python basics, bit of SQL, Power BI... and such funnny stuff.
I completed my project while working full time, so it's nothing big and sooo much more work needs to be done.
